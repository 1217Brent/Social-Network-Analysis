# Social-Network-Analysis

User Representation Using Matrix:

Use a 2D matrix to represent the social network.
Each row in the matrix will represent a user, and each column will represent a friendship connection between users.
The value at matrix[i][j] can indicate whether user i is friends with user j (e.g., 1 for friends, 0 for no friendship).

Adding New Users:

When a new user joins the social network, you'll need to add a new row to the matrix to represent the user.
The new row will initially have all 0s (indicating no friendships), as the user has not connected with anyone yet.

Establishing Friendship Connections:

When users connect with each other, you'll update the matrix to reflect their friendship status.
For example, if user A and user B become friends, you'll set matrix[i][j] and matrix[j][i] to 1.

Friend Recommendations using BFS:

You can still use the BFS algorithm to find friend recommendations for a user.
Instead of a list to keep track of visited users, you might use an array to keep track of visited rows in the matrix.

User Interests Using Matrix:

Similarly, you can use a separate matrix to represent user interests.
Each row represents a user, and each column represents a specific interest category.
The values in the matrix can indicate the user's interest level in each category.

DFS for Path Analysis:

The DFS algorithm can still be used to find paths between users in the social network by traversing the matrix.
